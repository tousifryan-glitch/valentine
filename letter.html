    <h2>My Love 💌</h2>
    <p>
     WISHING YOU A VERY VERY HAPPY FIRST MONTH ANNIVERSARY AND VALENTINES DAY
      From the moment you came into my life,  
      everything became brighter and warmer.  
      Thank you for choosing me as your Valentine.  
      I promise to always care for you and make you smile ❤️
      Trust me this had been one of the best month of my life .
      Ever since i met you my life has been more fun it got more colour
      IK we had some fights but every fight made our love even stronger 
      I wish i can always help you all stay  by your side 
      and i can love you always
      You are the person who is not only my gf but also my bestie my fashion adviser my yapping parter
      my game partner everything at all. I never expected i would find all this in same person
      you became this much important for me that whenever we are not with eachother i start missing you so bad
      As a friend i always wished that only if you were my gf . Trust me  I was way too much shocked  to know that you love me back.
      Whenever you sad or overthink it hurts me as much as you this actually shows how close are you to my heart
      At last ill say thanks a lot to select this nigga.
      Wish we get to marry eachother  in future 
      get to be with eachother in every bad time.
      I love you so so so much
      Hope we get to spend so much time with eachother with  many many anniversaries  and valentines.
    </p>
